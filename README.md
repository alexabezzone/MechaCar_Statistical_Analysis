## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![alt text](screenshots/RChallenge.png "Linear Regression")

1. After conducting the multiple linear regression analysis, the following variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
      - Vehicle Length: p-value = 2.60e-12
      - Ground Clearence: p-value = 5.21e-08

2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The R-Square reveals that the model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes (R-Square = .71). Because of the strong R-square, the null hypothesis that the slope of the linear line is equal to zero is rejected and the alternative hypotehsis is retained. 

3. The linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The R-Square reveals a strong prediction within the model (R-Square = .71) and rejects the null hypothesis that the slope of the linear model is equal to zero. Along with the R-Square, vehicle length and ground clearence are both statistically significant predictors of mpg, as both have P-values under .05. The R-Square and the P-value both reveal that the multiple linear regression model has significant predicting power.
